This project demonstrates the use of React state management hooks (useState and useReducer) with TypeScript. It consists of two main components:

Counter Component: A simple counter that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a count.
ShoppingCart Component: A dynamic shopping cart that supports adding items, removing items, and calculating the total cost.
These components showcase how to manage state effectively while leveraging TypeScript for type safety.

#Features
